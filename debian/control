Description: Audio/Video communications framework: core library
 The Farstream project is an effort to create a framework to deal with all
 known audio/video conferencing protocols. On one side it offers a generic
 API that makes it possible to write plugins for different streaming
 protocols, on the other side it offers an API for clients to use those
 plugins.
